      You know what
      <a href="https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/" target="_blank"
        >WORDLE</a
      >
      is, right? Where the program has a secret 5-letter word and you have to
      guess it? In SOLVLE the roles are reversed. You have a secret 5-letter
      word and the program has to guess it.
      <br /><br />
      Click the tiles with a letter in it to change its color.
      <ul>
        <li>
          If a letter is not in the word then turn the letter
          <span class="absent">THIS COLOR</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          If a letter is in the word but not the right spot then turn the letter
          <span class="present">THIS COLOR</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          If a letter is in the word and in the correct spot then turn the
          letter
          <span class="correct">THIS COLOR</span>
        </li>
      </ul>
      Once you have rated all five letters in the word, click "guess" to get the
      program's next guess.
      <br />
      <br />
      You can use SOLVLE to play WORDLE, by using SOLVLE's guesses in WORDLE and
      then using WORDLE's color ratings in SOLVLE.
      <br /><br />
      If you want to use SOLVLE to cheat even more you can click the "Cheat
      more" checkbox, and then SOLVLE will only guess known WORDLE solutions.
